# Two Hands, Two Touchpads: Optimizing Text Entry on Televisions

## Project Structure

The code for this project is split into 2 directories:

- `mobile-remote`: contains the logic for our mobile app which will detect touch input and send positional information to the web interface.
- `web-interface`: contains the keyboard interface and logic for mapping positional information onto the keyboard.
