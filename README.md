# Two Hands, Two Touchpads: Optimizing Text Entry on Televisions

## Project Structure

The code for this project is split into 2 directories:

- `mobile-remote`: contains the logic for our mobile app which will detect touch input and send positional information to the web interface.
- `web-interface`: contains the keyboard interface and logic for mapping positional information onto the keyboard.

### Mobile Remote



### Web Interface

The following commands can be used to build and run the web interface module

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
